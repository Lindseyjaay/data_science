#Talk the Walk: Political Alignment and Inaugural Addresses

<div align="center"><img src="http://dandelion-films.com/barack-obama-meme-tumblr-17.jpeg"></img></div>

**Project Goal:**
To map the political alignment of all 44 American presidents (and at least two fictional ones) based on the language used in their inaugural addresses.

**Questions:**
- What words, at least today, are considered "conservative" and "liberal" in political rhetoric?
- How "conservative" or "liberal" was each president, based solely on their inaugural addresses?
- How would Jed Bartlett and Matt Santos (both Democratic presidents from the television show "The West Wing") stack up to our real former presidents?

**Data**
I plan to use the transcriptions of inaugural addresses from Bartleby.com, and will collect the data by scraping each speech's respective page on the website.

**Type of Machine Learning**
This project addresses what mostly seems like supervised machine learning problem using categorical data, although the labels will likely be degrees on a scale, rather than binary.

**Reasons I Chose This Project**
I'm a huge fan of (a) the study of political rhetoric, (b) The West Wing, and (c) Matt Daniels' project on <a href="http://mfdaniels.tumblr.com/post/93313634355/updated-rappers-sorted-by-size-of-vocabulary-20">hip hop vocabulary</a>, which inspired this project greatly.
