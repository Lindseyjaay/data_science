=== What is Data Science? ===
Hacking Skills + Expertise + Mathematics and Statistics + Communication Skills

"Better programmer than most statisticians and better statisticians than most programmers."

=== Data Mining Workflow ===
Entire workflow is iterative:
* Acquire + Parse (Computer Science)
* Filter + Mine (Mathematics)
* Represent + Refine (Graphic Design)
* Interact (HCI)

=== Visualizations as a Medium ===
/* TODO(jaydelatorre): 
 *   REVIEW: mean, variance, correlation, line of best fit */

Datasets with similar statistical characteristics aren't necessarily similar visually.
