* GitHub
* Python

=== What is Data Science? ===
Hacking Skills + Expertise + Mathematics and Statistics + Communication Skills

"Better programmer than most statisticians and better statisticians than most programmers."

=== Data Mining Workflow ===
Entire workflow is iterative:
* Acquire + Parse (Computer Science)
* Filter + Mine (Mathematics)
* Represent + Refine (Graphic Design)
* Interact (HCI)

=== Visualizations as a Medium ===
* Mean (expected value): average of all values in a data set
* Variance: measures how far a set of numbers is spread out
* Correlation (dependence): any statistical relationship between two random variables or two sets of data
* Best fit line (linear regression): an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variable); 
    can be simple (one explanatory variable) or multivariate (multiple explanatory variables) 

Datasets with similar statistical characteristics aren't necessarily similar visually.

=== Lab: Git(Hub) and Python ===
Git(Hub) Concepts:
* Forking (only done with UI, unique to GitHub): creating a copy of a master repository in your own account
* Cloning (git clone): creating the pipeline between remote repository and local repository
* Fetching (git fetch): applies upstream changes since last fetch from original repository
* Merging (git merge): attempts to push downstream changes to upstream branch
* Pulling (git pull): automatically fetches and merges from original repository

/* TODO(justindelatorre):
 * Clarify differences between git fetch + git merge and git pull */
