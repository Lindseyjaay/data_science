Decision boundaries: result of creating perpendicular bisectors between points in a plane representing objects in a featurespace
* If something is similar in one respect, it's likely to be similar in other respects (i.e., applying precedent)

* Euclidean distance compared to existing data can sometimes present problems
* Another solution then would be to measure the cosine of the angle of the vector beginning at the origin as compared to that or the knowns
  - cos theta = (sigma unknown x known) / ||unknown|| ||known||

* distances in 3D: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2
                   OR d = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)**0.5
