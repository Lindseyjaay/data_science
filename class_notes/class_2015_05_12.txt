=== Introduction to Probability ===
The probability of an event A is denoted P(A), where the probability is a value between 0 and 1.

Sample space: set of all possible events, i.e, event A, event B, ..., event Z
* The probability of the sample space is 1
  - P(A) + P(B) + ... + P(Z) = 1

The _intersection_ of two events A and B is called the "joint probability" of A and B, or P(AB).

Conditional probability: the probability of some event A given that event B occurred
* P(A|B) = P(AB) / P(B)
  - The intersection of A and B divided by B
  - Represents the probability that both A and B happen, derived if B is given

Independent events do not affect each others' probabilities.
* P(A|B) = P(A)
  => P(A|B) = P(AB) / P(B) = P(A) = P(A) * P(B)

Bayes' Theorem (BT): P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A) / P(B)
* Often, we are given a few of the values in the equation above, so we can derive other values algebraically.

Interpretations of Probability:
* frequentist: an event's limiting frequency across a large number of trials
* Bayesian: the chance an event will occur regardless of how many times it has occurred in the past

=== Naive Bayesian Classification ===
In classification, BT allows us to determine the probability of a record belonging to a class, given the data we observe.

* Likelihood function: joint probability of a feature given that the record belongs to a class
* Prior probability: likelihood of a record belonging to a class before the data is taken into account
* Normalization constant: divisor in BT; usually considered after the fact
* Posterior probability: likelihood of a record belonging to a class after the data is taken into account

The _training phase_ of the model involves computing the Likelihood Function (conditional probability of each feature given each class).
The _prediction phase_ involves computing the posterior probability of each class given the observed features, and choosing the class with the highest probability.
