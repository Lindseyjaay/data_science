What is Big Data?
* O(n^2) algorithm feasible: small data
* Fits on one machine: medium data
* Doesn't fit on one machine: big data

=== What is machine learning? ===
Branch of AI that is about the construction and study of systems the can learn from the data

Deals with "representation" and "generalization"
 * representation: extracting structure from the data > "What does the data look like?" (i.e., social graphs)
 * generalization: making predications from the data > "What does the data mean?" (i.e., forecasting)
